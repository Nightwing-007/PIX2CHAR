PIX2CHAR uses MongoDB for storing user data, image uploads, and ASCII outputs. MongoDB’s schema-flexible nature allows us to store documents with varying structures — ideal for an evolving project.

As new features like colored ASCII, GIF support, or metadata (e.g., processing time, filters) are added, MongoDB makes it easy to extend the data model without breaking existing records or requiring schema migrations.

This flexibility ensures fast iteration, better scalability, and smoother development compared to rigid SQL-based schemas.
